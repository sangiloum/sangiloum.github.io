{{< home-logo variant="home-logo-compact" href="https://www.kmo.or.kr" src="/legacy/2011/12/kmo-logo-pink.gif" alt="Korean Mathematical Olympiad" >}}

I was involved in selecting and educating highly gifted students in Korea to compete in [International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)](http://www.imo-official.org). For 2011-2012 and 2017-2018, I was an executive member of the Board of Trustees, Korean Mathematical Society in charge of the Korean Mathematical Olympiad (KMO).
