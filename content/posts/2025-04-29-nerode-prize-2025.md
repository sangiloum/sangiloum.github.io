## Nerode Prize 2025 — Call for Nominations

The [EATCS-IPEC Nerode Prize](https://eatcs.org/index.php/nerode-prize) for outstanding papers in the area of multivariate algorithmics is presented annually, with the presentation taking place at IPEC (International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation). The Prize is named in honor of [Anil Nerode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Nerode) in recognition of his major contributions to mathematical logic, theory of automata, computability, and complexity theory.

[IPEC 2025](https://algo-conference.org/2025/ipec/) will take place as part of [ALGO 2025](https://algo-conference.org/2025/) on 17–19 September 2025 at University of Warsaw in Warsaw, Poland. 

The prize was awarded for the first time in 2013.

## Award Committee

The winning paper(s) is selected by a committee of three members. This year’s committee consists of:

  - [Sang-il Oum](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/home/sangil/), chair (IBS, sangil \_at\_ ibs.re.kr)
  - [Russell Impagliazzo](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/) (UC San Diego, rimpagliazzo \_at\_ ucsd.edu)
  - [Michał Pilipczuk](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~mp248287/) (Univ. of Warsaw, mp.pilipczuk \_at\_ uw.edu.pl)

Deadline for Nominations: Saturday, 31 May, 2025, anywhere on Earth

Decision, expected: 30 June, 2025.

The Award Committee is solely responsible for the selection of the winner of the award which may be shared by more than one paper or series of papers. The Award Committee reserves the right to declare no winner at all.

## Eligibility

The Nerode Prize is given to a research paper or series of research papers by a single author or by a team of authors published in a recognized refereed journal. The research work nominated for the award should be in the area of multivariate algorithms and complexity meant in a broad sense, which encompasses, but is not restricted to, those areas covered by IPEC. The Award Committee has the ultimate authority to decide on the eligibility of a nomination. Papers authored by a member of the Award Committee are not eligible for nomination.

Note that the past restrictions that required a certain number of years before/after the publication of the nominated papers have been removed.

## Nominations

Nominations may be made by any member of the scientific community including the members of the Award Committee. A nomination should contain a brief summary of the technical content of each nominated paper and a brief explanation of its significance. Nominations are done by an email to the Award Committee Chair with copies to the members of the committee. The Subject line of the nomination e-mail should contain the phrase “**Nerode Prize Nomination**“.
