> I am advertising a PhD position in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, see the link below: <https://umu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:467679/> . I would be most grateful if you could forward this link to any master’s students of yours at KAIST who may be interested.

> Our combinatorics group has been rather fortunate in recruitment of late — Klas Markström and I have been joined by Maryam Sharifzadeh, Klara Stokes and István Tomon in the past two years — so we can hopefully offer an attractive environment for a PhD student (as well as fun research problems).
