#### 1\. Purpose and Background

With the vision of **“Making Discoveries for Humanity and Society,”** the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) was founded in 2011 by the Korean government to promote basic sciences in Korea. Thirty Research Centers have been launched and each Center has been yielding outstanding results in various fields of research.  
The **IBS “Young Scientist Fellowship”** started in 2016 to play an active role in fostering next-generation basic science leaders. We believe this fellowship offers opportunities to conduct independent research by utilizing state-of-art infrastructures and to grow on the basis of research collaborations with leading researchers.
