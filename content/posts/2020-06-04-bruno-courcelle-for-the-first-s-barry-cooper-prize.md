> “[The 2020 S. Barry Cooper Prize is awarded to Bruno Courcelle for his work on the definability of graph properties in Monadic Second Order Logic, through a sequence of seminal papers and a book (joint with Joost Engelfriet)](https://www.acie.eu/2020/06/03/2020-s-barry-cooper-prize-awarded-to-bruno-courcelle/). This forms an outstanding example of theory building, bringing together logic, computability, graph grammars, and various notions of graph width (tree-width, clique-width and rank-width) and opening new avenues in our understanding of graph structure theory and the computability and complexity of graph algorithms. Besides its foundational character, the work has had great impact on a number of areas of computer science, including in parameterized algorithmics, verification and other areas, and has influenced a generation of researchers in this field. It has straddled the divide between the logical and algorithmic aspects of theoretical computer science.”

Big Congratulations to [Bruno Courcelle](https://www.labri.fr/perso/courcell/) for the first S. Barry Cooper Prize. I was very fortunate to meet him at Dagstuhl in 2004, resulting a nice paper on Seese’s conjecture and an algorithm to decide rank-width≤k, making two chapters of my Ph.D. thesis. 

In the photo, you can find me and Bruno.
