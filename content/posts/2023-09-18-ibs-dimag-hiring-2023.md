The IBS Discrete Mathematics Group (DIMAG, <https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/>) in Daejeon, Korea invites applications for three research fellowship positions.

DIMAG is a research group that was established on December 1, 2018 at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), led by [Prof. Sang-il Oum](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/home/sangil/).
