The [IBS Discrete Mathematics Group](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/) (DIMAG) in Daejeon, Korea invites applications for **four** research fellowship positions (senior researcher positions).

DIMAG is a research group that was established on December 1, 2018 at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), led by its Chief Investigator (CI) [Sang-il Oum](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/home/sangil/). DIMAG is located at the headquarters of IBS in Daejeon, South Korea, a city of 1.5 million people. Currently, DIMAG consists of researchers from various countries and the work is done in English. DIMAG is co-located with the [IBS Extremal Combinatorics and Probability Group (ECOPRO)](https://www.ibs.re.kr/ecopro/).
