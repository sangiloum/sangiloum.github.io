### Classification of nonorientable regular embeddings of Hamming graphs

### [Young Soo Kwon](http://math.yu.ac.kr/math/sub01_b.htm) (권영수), Yeungnam University

In this talk, the classification of nonorientable regular embeddings of Hamming graph will be considered. The classification shows that there exists a nonorientable regular embedding of Hamming graph H(n,d) if and only if (n=2 and d=2) or (n=3,4) or (n=6 and d=1 or 2) . This is a joint wok with Gareth A. Jones.

### Asymmetric Highly Ramsey Infinite Graphs

### [Mark H. Siggers](https://www.siggers.work), Kyungpook National University

A graph G is ramsey for a pair of graphs (B,R) if any two-colouring (with blue and red) of the edges yields a blue copy of B or a red copy of R. A pair (B,R) is ramsey infinite if there are an infinite class of graphs that are edge-critical with respect to being ramsey for (B,R).  
We talk about several results classifying which pairs are ramsey infinite, and a recent result showing that if B and R are odd-cycles, then not only is (B,R) ramsey-infinite, but there are 2^{O(n^2)} non-isomorphic graphs on n vertices that are edge-critical with respect to being ramsey for (B,R).

### A Moore bound for irregular graphs?

### [Jack Koolen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~koolen/), POSTECH

A k-regular graph with diameter D can have at most 1 + k + k(k-1) + …+ k(k-1)^{D-1} vertices. This is known as the Moore bound. In this talk I discuss several versions of this bound for irregular graphs.

### Splitting a Graph by a Circuit

### [Tommy R. Jensen](https://web.archive.org/web/20171226202656/http://webbuild.knu.ac.kr:80/~trj/), Kyungpook National Unversity

We try to identify a property of circuits in (nonplanar) graphs resembling the separation property of circuits in planar graphs that is derived from the Jordan Curve Theorem. We observe that a conjectured such property implies a strong form of a version of Seymour’s Cycle Double Cover Conjecture due to Luis Goddyn. Our main result proves that the suggested property holds for Hamilton circuits in cubic graphs.
