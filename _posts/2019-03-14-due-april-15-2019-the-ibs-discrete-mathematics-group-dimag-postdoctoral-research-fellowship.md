The [IBS Discrete Mathematics Group (DIMAG)](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/) in Daejeon, Korea invites applications for several postdoctoral research fellowship positions. The expected start date is the 1st of September 2019 but it can be negotiated; but the candidate should have a Ph.D. by the start date.

DIMAG is a new research group that was established in December 1, 2018 at the [Institute for Basic Science](https://www.ibs.re.kr/) (IBS), led by Prof. [Sang-il Oum](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/home/sangil/). DIMAG is located at the headquarters of the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Daejeon, South Korea, a city of 1.5 million people.

Successful candidates for postdoctoral research fellowship positions will be new or recent Ph.D.’s with outstanding research potential in all fields of **discrete mathematics** with emphasis on **structural graph theory, extremal graph theory, combinatorial optimization, matroid theory, or fixed-paramter tractable algorithms**.

These non-tenure-track appointments are for two or three years, and the starting salary is no less than KRW 57,000,000. The appointment is one time renewable up to 5 years in total contingent upon the outstanding performance of the researcher.

These are purely research positions and research fellows will have no teaching duties.

A complete application packet should include:

1.  AMS standard cover sheet (preferred) or cover letter (PDF format)
2.  Curriculum vitae including a publication list (PDF format)
3.  Research statement (PDF format)
4.  At least 3 recommendation letters

For full consideration, applicants should email items 1, 2, and 3 and arrange their recommendation letters emailed to **dimag@ibs.re.kr** by Monday, April 15, 2019. Recommendations letters forwarded by an applicant will not be considered.

DIMAG encourages applications from individuals of diverse backgrounds.
