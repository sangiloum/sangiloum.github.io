I’m sharing a message from [Hemanshu Kaul](http://www.math.iit.edu/~kaul/) at Illinois Tech.

> We are hiring a postdoc in Discrete Math at IIT (Illinois Tech) to start in Fall 2022. It is a one year position followed by one year extension subject to performance review and funding. In the past every such position has been extended for the second year.
> 
> We are interested in candidates with broad research interests in discrete mathematics and its applications. In particular, we are interested in all aspects of graph theory: extremal, enumerative, topological, and spectral; and algorithms and models in network and discrete optimization. Connections to machine learning, graph neural nets, and related computational fields are a plus.
> 
> Further details and the link for submitting a short application (cover letter, CV, and references) are available at: <https://forms.gle/xza2Gj9eJhMkVzq69>
