IBS is inviting applications for Young Scientist Fellowship. The application due is May 31, 2020. To be eligible, one should be within 7 years of obtaining a Ph.D. or under the age of 40 with a Ph.D. (born no earlier than 1 January 1980).

This is a full-time research position and the appointment is for 3 years with a possible 2-year extension depending on the performance review results. *(If a current IBS researcher is appointed as YSF, then the maximum duration is 3 years.)*

Please check <https://www.ibs.re.kr/ysf/> and  <https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/ysf/>for more information. 

IBS DIMAG will also have a few openings. The successful candidate will join the discrete mathematics group with his or her own separate research budget.
