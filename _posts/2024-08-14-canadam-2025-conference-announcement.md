Mini-symposiums are easy to organize, a great way to get your research colleagues together in one place and an opportunity to invite researchers you admire to explain their work to you\! Proposals will be due Feb 10, 2025. Contributed Minisymposium proposals must include a short description of the Minisymposia (maximum of 200 words), as well the names of the proposed speakers. Your proposed speakers should represent the diversity of the area and have already accepted to give a talk in your Contributed Minisymposium\!
